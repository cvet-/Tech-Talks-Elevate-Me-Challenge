# Tech-Talks-Elevate-Me-Challenge
## THE CHALLENGE: HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN YOU ELEVATE IN 10 MINUTES?
It’s 8:50 AM at Infinity Tower, and employees are rushing to get to work by 9:00 AM. The only thing standing in their way is the elevators. Your goal is to transport as many people as possible to their workplaces via elevator, but you only have 10 minutes to do so. It’s time to roll up your sleeves and come up with an efficient algorithm written in JavaScript to control the building’s elevators and get everyone to work on time!
